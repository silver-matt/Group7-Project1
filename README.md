## CRAVING FINDER

### USER STORY
I want a quick way to look up ingredients that I'll need for any given recipe
So that i don't need to waste time reading through a recipe websites that always seems to put the author's life story before the actual recipe.
*   Given the name of a food or drink item 
    - When I search that  food or drink name
        - Then I'll get the ingredient list I'll need

  - We couldn't do the originally planned site because of the limitations to free API's.
