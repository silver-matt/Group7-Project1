### USER STORY
When the user first enters the site, they will will have the option to choose if they would like a food or a drink. Once the corresponding button is click with user will be directed to a search page for either food or drinks. Once the user enters their choice and the search button is clicked, the page should then display the name, list of ingredients, and image of the closest match for that search. If there are additional options for the search the user can switch between them using the arrow buttons on the side.
